## Design Choices
### Fonts
I have used the"Roboto" font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and liked the way it presents although I did explore the website for other fonts and have noted other styles for future projects.

### Icons
The use of icons has been kept the minimum and from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library and use them for social media and a download option.


### Colours
The color scheme used for the website was a green background with golden lettering. I chose these colours because i wanted the user to feel an air of quality and exclusivity, from previous subconcious experience. This colour scheme is similiar to that used by Rolex and Wimbledon tennis tournamemt (this was underway during the design process). I hoped the clientele for the gym would be fimiliar with these and connect those enternties of quality would also be associated with the gym.
The background was #277676 and the text was #EC9209 but after runner a colour contrast test on the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website it scored badly and with a subtle change from green background a better scored was achieved without losing the "quality" look of the website.

### Structure
For my website I chose to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Bootstrap is a library of HTML, CSS & Javascrpit, focused on mobile first. As this is the primary format for the website to be diplayed it improves that this website will work well on mobile.

The first column (col-md-6) and the further two columns Col-md-3), The first column has the doenload link with the two other columns have the buttons for booking classes and member login.

## Testing

During testing I extensively used Chrome Developer Tools, ensuring the website acted correctly with various screen sizes.
I also used the following to fine tune the process;
 * W3C Markup validator tool for HTML.
 * W3C CSS validator tool for CSS
 * Lightouse (chrome developer tools) for security and load times.

Button for member's Login, this feature is to follow at a later date. AS a temorary solution when the button is pressed the user is relocated to the website contact page.
Unfortunately this solution as it is correctly coded raises an error in the W3C markup validator. I will look into the adding a modal to the button advising the feature is currently unvailable. This will resolve the issue with he W3C markup validator report. This also applies to the book classes button feature. This solution will be added to the website by the close of play on the 15th July 2021.

As discussed in ## Design Choices above whilst using coolors to find a better colour contrast the new choice of coloyrs but after changing the colour in the logo but reverted to the previous scheme because I felt it gave a bodlder aesthetic style to the website.

Whilst using Chrome's Lighthouse there was a slight overflow issue using the extension Unicorn Revealer showed all was in order.

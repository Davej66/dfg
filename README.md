## Design Choices
### Fonts
I have used the "Roboto" font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and liked the way it presents although I did explore the website for other fonts and have noted other styles for future projects.

### Icons
The use of icons has been kept the minimum and from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library and use them for social media and a download option.


### Colours
The colour scheme used for the website was a green background with golden lettering. I chose these colours because i wanted the user to feel an air of quality and exclusivity, from previous subconscious experience. This colour scheme is similar to that used by Rolex and Wimbledon tennis tournament (this was underway during the design process). I hoped the clientele for the gym would be fimiliar with these and connect those entities of quality and would also be associated with the gym.

The original colours were the background was #277676 and the text was #EC9209 but after runner a colour contrast test on the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website it scored badly and with a subtle change from green background a better scored was achieved without losing the "quality" look of the website.

![Original palette (DFG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85559896/126037957-8f84df7a-8b9d-4f85-8568-888c61a50b5b.png)

The final colours now for the background are #0B2222 and the text #FAC16B but the text on the light areas continued to score badly so these were changed from #EC9209 to #0B2222 and the background colour to #FBFBFB from #FFFFFF.

### Structure
For my website I chose to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Bootstrap is a library of HTML, CSS & Javascrpit, focused on mobile first. As this is the primary format for the website to be displayed it improves that this website will work well on mobile.

## Testing
### Approach and Tools
As I had deployed my website by my midpoint meeting with my mentor [Richard Wells](https://github.com/D0nni387/) I was in a position to commence testing my website. I was using chrome's web DevTool on every change I made to the website to see the impact and if it met expectations.

Once I had the structure in place, I began testing across other devices screen sizes with chrome's DevTools. Further down the development timeline I also included testing on actual devices; A samsung s20 Ultra, samsung s8, iphone 12 and ipad 4 to complement chrome DevTool.

I also was able to ask family to review the website on their devices for their opinion and issues they encountered.

### Validator Testing
I also used the following to fine tune the process;
 * W3C Markup validator tool for HTML.
 * W3C CSS validator tool for CSS
 * Lighthouse (chrome developer tools) for security and load times.

### Bugs and Solutions

The button for 'Members Login'![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85559896/126046640-5e58aaa4-b48d-4642-9520-de55c457ba8c.png)is for the feature that is to follow at a later date. As a temorary solution when the button is pressed the user is relocated to the website contact page.
The original code used to achieve this raised an error in the W3C markup validator, looking in the bootstrap documentationa the solution was found, this was also applied to the Book classes here button![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85559896/126047049-8427d393-2bd0-42f9-b58a-14145cd6c328.png) by the close of play on the 15th July 2021.

As discussed in Design Choices above whilst using coolors to find a better colour contrast the new choice of colours. After changing the colour in the logo to the current colour scheme I decided to revert the logo to original colour scheme because I felt it gave a bolder aesthetic style to the website.

Whilst using Chrome's Lighthouse there was a slight overflow issue, using the extension Unicorn Revealer showed all what was required to resolve the issue swiftly.

During testing to make the contact form to standing out a bit more an off-white was decide upon and actioned.

The contact form will not submit untill the required fields have been populated but the feature to send to the gym will follow later so when submitted the user is returned to the top of the page. This will decided upon during testing not to leave the user with a broken feature, also the contact form requires a reset function. This is available in javascript and will be implemented later in development of the project after 18th July 2021.

The google map used in the contact us section does locate the gym's location correctly because I have used the map from the previous business's map and when launhed in a new paged gives this not dissolved business details. This is not ideal and going forward a new google map unique to the gym will be generated from the google map application.

The download function in the Schedule section of the gym's classes timetable worked correctly opening a pdf in new page when in the dev environment but when deployed 
a 404 is displayed in the new page.

It was identified that a forward slash was the cause of the error and once removed the pdf correcting opened.

## Deployment

The project after the completed code has been commited and pushed to GitHub can be deployed and [found here.](https://davej66.github.io/dfg/). This is achieved by navigating to the page holding the project repository and executing the following steps:

1. From the menu select **Settings**.
2. Scrolling down the vertical menu (topped by Options) select **Pages** which leads to the **Source section**.
3. Under Source click the drop-down menu labelled None and select Main Branch.
4. You are then required to choose a folder, either Docs or root. You should select root.
5. You can now save these selections and the link to the deployed website will be dosplayed.
6. The website is live https://davej66.github.io/dfg/ .

### To run the project locally:
This achieve by the following process;
1. Under the repository name and the menu that contains Gitpod click Code.
2. Select HTTPS the location will already be present.
3. To the right of this address is an icon once this clicked the location will be cloned.
4. the clone can be found at this [https://github.com/Davej66/dfg.git](https://github.com/Davej66/dfg.git).
